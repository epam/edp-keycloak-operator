## Architecture Scheme of Keycloak Operator

This page contains a representation of the current Keycloak Operator architecture that is built using the plantUML capabilities. 
All the diagrams sources are placed under the **/puml** directory of the current folder. 

An Image of the HEAD of the current branch will be displayed as a result of an Image building with the plant uml proxy server. 

If you are in the detached mode, use the sources to get the required version of diagrams.
